- Infinite set of silly mathematical jokes.

- Permissive Open Hardware Licence - do whatever you want with it.

- Not just PCBs, this repo contains STEP for a decent and easy to print case.
  Your build will be very solid.

- Reversible, no need to order 10 boards.

- MX Hotswap.

- Robust through-hole USB-C socket for interconnection:

    - Very reliable.

    - Does not fry MCU I/Os by design.

    - Cables are available in every shop on the planet.

- Easy to source parts.

This keyboard is compact, reliable, and relatively easy to build. It is
diodeless, the protection circuit is optional. Only the TH USB-C connector
could be an annoyance for an inexperienced builder, but thatâ€™s it. Everything
else should be smooth.
